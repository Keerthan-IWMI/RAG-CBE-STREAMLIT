      "content": "**Overview:** The circular economy in agriculture, particularly in water-scarce regions like the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), focuses on recovering water, nutrients, and energy from wastewater to enhance water security and sustainable development. [Source 1] [Source 2]\n\n**Key Points:**\n• Circular economy approaches provide alternatives to linear models by capturing value from waste materials, such as reclaiming water and nutrients from wastewater for agricultural use. [Source 2]\n\n• Reusing treated wastewater in agriculture helps meet irrigation demands, conserves freshwater resources, and supports water-scarce regions facing climate change challenges. [Source 1] [Source 2]\n\n**Implications:**\n• Adopting circular water reuse in agriculture can improve water security, reduce environmental impact, and create economic opportunities by turning waste into valuable resources. [Source 1] [Source 2]\n\nWould you like to explore specific technologies or policy measures that support circular economy practices in agricultural water reuse?",

          "page_content": "Globally, the circular economy is seen as a better approach than the linear, take-make-dispose economy. The circular economy seeks to create and capture value in what would otherwise be waste materials and maximize that value to promote sustainable development. Recovering the water, energy, nutrients, and other materials embedded in water is a significant opportunity and is gaining more attention in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region for meeting the demand. Additionally, water reuse represents economic value by providing increased water flows and contributing to the conservation of freshwater resources.",

          "page_content": "We need alternatives such as circular economy (CE) approaches to supply water in view of the water scarcity and climate change challenges and the need to ensure water security in urban and rural areas. One of the essential dimensions of a CE is the creation and capture of value remaining in waste materials and maximizing that value to promote sustainable development. Recovering the water, energy, nutrients and other materials embedded in wastewater is a key opportunity. This notion of wastewater recovery is gaining more attention in water-scarce countries as a way to meet the demand as non-conventional water resources can be used for irrigation in agriculture, industrial use and groundwater recharge.",
