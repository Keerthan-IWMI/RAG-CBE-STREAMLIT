      "content": "**Overview:** Wastewater reuse for agriculture, forestry, and aquaculture is widely practiced, especially in the global South, where untreated or partially treated wastewater is used on a much larger scale than treated wastewater. [Source 1]\n\n**Key Points:**\n• The reuse of raw or diluted wastewater for irrigating field crops occurs on up to 35 million hectares around cities in the global South. [Source 1]\n• Most of this irrigation relies on untreated or only partially treated wastewater, at a scale thirty times larger than areas using treated wastewater. [Source 1]\n• Research and publications highlight practices, safe reuse, and perspectives for wastewater irrigation, including case studies from regions like Mexico and the Middle East. [Source 2]\n• Specific regional analyses, such as in the Middle East and North Africa, document the progression of water reuse from principle to practice. [Source 3]\n\n**Implications:**\n• There is a significant gap between the widespread use of untreated wastewater and the safer application of treated wastewater, highlighting a major public health and environmental challenge.\n• Documented cases from various regions provide valuable lessons for developing safer reuse protocols and policies.\n\n| **Aspect** | **Scale/Detail** |\n|------------|------------------|\n| Global South Irrigation Area | Up to 35 million hectares [Source 1] |\n| Treated vs. Untreated Use | Untreated wastewater use is 30x larger [Source 1] |\n\nWould you like to explore specific health risks associated with untreated wastewater use or the policies promoting safer reuse practices?",
