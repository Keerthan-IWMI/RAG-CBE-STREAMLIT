      "content": "**Overview:** Based on IWMI case studies, investment costs for biomass gasification plants using agro-waste typically range from approximately USD 1,000 to USD 1,400 per kW of installed capacity for small to medium-scale operations [Source 1].\n\n**Key Points:**\n• The cost range applies to gasification systems with a production scale of 25–100 kW [Source 1].\n\n• This model is suited for rural areas with abundant crop residues to ensure consistent agro-waste supply [Source 1].\n\n**Implications:**\n• Investors and project developers can use this range for preliminary feasibility assessments and financial planning.\n\n• The scale (small-medium) aligns with decentralized energy solutions, supporting local energy access and circular agro-waste use.\n\nWould you like more details on the socio-economic impacts or operational considerations for such gasification plants?",
