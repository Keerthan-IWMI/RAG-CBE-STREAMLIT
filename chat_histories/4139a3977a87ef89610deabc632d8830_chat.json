It can be scaled horizontally and has a potential for vertical scaling by expanding into the business of adding value to biochar for domestic and industrial use. It has a strong potential to be implemented in agriculture intensive regions. The business model scores relatively low on innovation as it is fairly straightforward with no sophisticated technology requirements. However, it may require innovative partnership and ﬁnancing arrangements.",

The business is eligible for sale of carbon as ethanol is a biofuel and is generated from sustainable biomass source. Furthermore, the production of ethanol results in vinasse, a by-product of waste distillation which can be treated to recover clean water. Finally, there is also the potential to produce value-added animal feed, biogas and bio-fertilizers by further processing of remaining sludge. FIGURE 114.

One of the essential dimensions of a CE is the creation and capture of value remaining in waste materials and maximizing that value to promote sustainable development. Recovering the water, energy, nutrients and other materials embedded in wastewater is a key opportunity. This notion of wastewater recovery is gaining more attention in water-scarce countries as a way to meet the demand as non-conventional water resources can be used for irrigation in agriculture, industrial use and groundwater recharge.",
