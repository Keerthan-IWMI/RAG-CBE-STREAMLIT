      "content": "**Overview:**\nWastewater reuse for irrigation is extensively practiced across the Global South, particularly in the Middle East, North Africa, and around urban areas, often using untreated or partially treated water on a scale far exceeding the use of treated wastewater [Source 1].\n\n**Key Points:**\n• In the Global South, raw or diluted wastewater is used to irrigate field crops on up to 35 million hectares, which is about thirty times the area using treated wastewater [Source 1].\n\n• Reuse practices are documented in regions like the Middle East and North Africa, where treated effluent is applied beneficially, such as in the United Arab Emirates [Source 3].\n\n• Research highlights the need for safe reuse practices and best management strategies to mitigate risks associated with wastewater irrigation [Source 4].\n\n**Implications:**\n• Policymakers should prioritize safe reuse guidelines and treatment infrastructure to reduce health and environmental risks from untreated wastewater irrigation.\n\n• There is significant potential to scale up formal, treated wastewater reuse to match the extensive informal practice, supporting water security and agricultural productivity.\n\nWould you like to know more about specific regional practices, such as in the Middle East and North Africa, or the health risks associated with untreated wastewater use?",

Most of this irrigation is using untreated or at best partially treated wastewater, at a thirty times larger scale than the known areas using treated wastewater (Scott et al., 2010); Thebo et al., 2017.",
