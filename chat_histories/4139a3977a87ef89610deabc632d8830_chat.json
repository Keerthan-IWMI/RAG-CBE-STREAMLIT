      "content": "**Overview:** Treated wastewater can serve as a reliable, low-cost irrigation source, reducing groundwater dependence by providing year-round water access and nutrient benefits, especially where freshwater scarcity is high [Source 2].\n\n**Key Points:**\n• Treated wastewater offers farmers guaranteed all-year access to low-priced water, directly substituting scarce groundwater or canal water, which can serve less than 5% of the water market [Source 1].\n• Farmers using treated wastewater can save on fertilizer costs due to its nutrient content, with reported gains of USD 80–500 per hectare and doubled yields for crops like wheat and tomatoes [Source 2].\n• In regions like Drarga, treated wastewater is sold to farmers facing groundwater scarcity and high pumping costs, ensuring irrigation continuity during droughts [Source 2].\n• Salinity concerns can limit adoption; reducing salinity levels (e.g., to 1.4 mS/cm) makes reclaimed water more acceptable to farmers who normally prefer less saline sources [Source 4].\n\n**Implications:**\n• Policies should promote treated wastewater as a drought-resilient resource, coupled with salinity control to increase farmer acceptance [Source 4].\n• Business models can integrate water treatment fees with affordable irrigation services, enhancing cost-recovery and farmer livelihoods [Source 2].\n• Extension services should highlight agronomic benefits (e.g., nutrient value) to overcome preferences for untreated wastewater [Source 1].\n\n**Adoption Challenges & Solutions:**\n| Challenge | Evidence-Based Insight |\n|-----------|------------------------|\n| Low adoption due to salinity | Post-treatment salinity reduction to ~1.4 mS/cm increases usability [Source 4] |\n| Farmer preference for untreated wastewater | Untreated wastewater preferred for higher nutrient content; education on treated water’s balanced benefits needed [Source 1] |\n| Limited risk awareness | Low-cost on-farm safety measures can reduce health risks where formal treatment is scarce [Source 3] |\n\nWould you like more details on specific crops that benefit from treated wastewater or the economic models for pricing treated water for farmers?",

          "page_content": "It is noteworthy that more than 90% of the farm households choose untreated wastewater although treated wastewater is in same proximity and cheaper. Freshwater alternatives like canal water and groundwater are too scarce and can only serve less than 5% of the water market. The reasons for choosing untreated wastewater are of agronomic nature, directly affecting farmers livelihoods: the treatment process is increasing water salinity (see below) beyond what some of their crops can tolerate while signiﬁcantly reducing the nitrogen and phosphorus content of the water. In fact, 70% of farmers using untreated wastewater reported that they stopped applying fertilizers, and 24% only used very targeted fertilizer applications (Ensink, 2006; Clemett and Ensink, 2006).",

Farmers beneﬁt through guaranteed all-year access to low-priced water, and savings on fertilizer. A number of local ﬁeld trials showed that farmers can gain through the use of the treated wastewater between USD 80 and more than USD 500 per ha with variations between crops (EAU, 2004; Choukr-Allah et al., 2005; Choukr-Allah and Hamdy, 2005; Mohamed and Young, 2013). Common crops in the areas, irrigated via surface, micro jet or drip systems are for example wheat, maize, tomatoes, zucchini, alfalfa and clover. With on average doubled yields using wastewater compared to irrigation with other water sources (Hirich and Choukr-Allah, 2013), price advantages could also be extended to consumers (Figure 215).",

          "page_content": "As informal wastewater reuse ﬂourishes especially in low-income countries where not only wastewater treatment capacities are limited, but also regulations weak and banning of wastewater irrigation neither practical nor feasible, the challenge is how to implement safety measures in this situation. From a technical perspective, there are many low-cost options available for on- farm and post-harvest risk reduction which can on their own or ideally in combination (multi- barrier approach) signiﬁcantly reduce health risks for farmers and consumers, especially from pathogens. However, due to low risk awareness in the population there is limited market demand and ﬁnancial incentive for safety measures. A high adoption rate is however required for any larger impact and cost-effectiveness (Drechsel and Seidu, 2011).",

As drought conditions vary, the water exchange was set up on voluntary base without speciﬁc quantitative targets. In general, most farmers prefer the usually less saline river or groundwater. Only when these sources get scarce, and farmers are no longer allowed to abstract water, reclaimed water was used. The efforts by the authorities to install additional treatment capacity for halving the salinity level of the reclaimed water to about 1.4 millisiemens per centimeter (mS/cm) responded directly to farmers water quality concerns.",
