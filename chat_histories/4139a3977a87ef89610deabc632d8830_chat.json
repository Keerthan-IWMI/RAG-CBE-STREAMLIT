[Source 2] [Source 3]\n\n**Key Points:**\n• Agro-industrial waste like bagasse and molasses from sugar-processing can be used in cogeneration units to produce combined heat and power. [Source 1]\n• Molasses can be processed in a distillery to produce ethanol, which has demand from beverage, pharmaceutical, and fuel-blending sectors. [Source 2]\n• Spent wash (distillery effluent) can be treated in biogas units to generate biogas for energy and produce nutrient-rich bio-fertilizer for farmers. [Source 2] [Source 3]\n• Vinasse, a by-product of alcohol production, can be repurposed into organic binders or other products, avoiding unlawful dumping and environmental harm. [Source 4]\n\n**Implications:**\n• Factories can diversify revenue streams and improve profitability by valorizing waste. [Source 1] [Source 2]\n• Adopting circular models reduces environmental pollution and supports sustainable agriculture through bio-fertilizer distribution. [Source 2] [Source 4]\n• Policies promoting ethanol blending or renewable energy tariffs can incentivize such investments.

Pune, Maharashtra that produces sugar from sugarcane grown by its farmer members. In the process producing sugar, it produces bagasse and molasses as waste products. In order to address ﬂuctuations in proﬁts in the sugar unit itself, SSSSK has made additional investments in a distillery unit producing ethanol using molasses; a biogas unit generating biogas using spent wash from the distillery; a cogeneration facility generating combined heat and power using bagasse and biogas and bio-fertilizer using press mud from biogas plant. There is signiﬁcant demand for the ethanol from companies producing alcoholic beverages as well as pharmaceutical companies. The government has also put in place a requirement of 5% ethanol blending of fuel, which has created a demand for ethanol from petroleum companies. The biogas produced is used internally as input fuel to the boiler while the bio-fertilizer (the discharge from the biogas unit), which is high in organic matter, is distributed at no cost to the farmers in proportion to the cane supplied by them. The electricity generated by the cogeneration unit partially used internally and surplus is sold to the state electricity utility by way of a long-term power purchase agreement at a pre-determined incentive tariff that has been set by the MERC. SSSSK assists the member cane growers to increase cane growth by providing quality seed and tissue culture plantlets, introducing modern techniques of cultivation, integrated nutrient management, irrigation water management and pest management and providing bio-fertilizers to its members. SSSSKs operations have led to signiﬁcant socio-economic beneﬁts",

[Source 1] [Source 3]\n\n**Key Points:**\n• Treated wastewater can supplement scarce freshwater sources like canal water and groundwater, which serve less than 5% of the water market in some regions, thereby alleviating pressure on these resources. [Source 1]\n• Farmers often prefer untreated wastewater due to its higher nutrient content (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus) and lower salinity compared to treated versions, which can increase salinity and reduce fertiliser value. [Source 1]\n• Voluntary water exchange systems using treated effluent can support seasonal irrigation for up to 1,000 ha, but usage typically occurs only when freshwater sources become scarce or access is restricted. [Source 3]\n• Reducing salinity levels in treated wastewater (e.g., to 1.4 mS/cm) through additional treatment can address farmer concerns and increase adoption for irrigation. [Source 3]\n\n**Implications:**\n• Enhancing treatment processes to retain nutrients and control salinity can make treated wastewater more attractive to farmers, promoting its use and conserving groundwater.

Freshwater alternatives like canal water and groundwater are too scarce and can only serve less than 5% of the water market. The reasons for choosing untreated wastewater are of agronomic nature, directly affecting farmers livelihoods: the treatment process is increasing water salinity (see below) beyond what some of their crops can tolerate while signiﬁcantly reducing the nitrogen and phosphorus content of the water. In fact, 70% of farmers using untreated wastewater reported that they stopped applying fertilizers, and 24% only used very targeted fertilizer applications (Ensink, 2006; Clemett and Ensink, 2006).",

From a technical perspective, there are many low-cost options available for on- farm and post-harvest risk reduction which can on their own or ideally in combination (multi- barrier approach) signiﬁcantly reduce health risks for farmers and consumers, especially from pathogens. However, due to low risk awareness in the population there is limited market demand and ﬁnancial incentive for safety measures. A high adoption rate is however required for any larger impact and cost-effectiveness (Drechsel and Seidu, 2011).",
