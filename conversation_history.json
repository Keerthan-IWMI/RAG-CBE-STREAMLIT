[Source 2]\n•   **Cross-Seasonal Access:** The reuse of treated wastewater improves access to irrigation water across different seasons, facilitating year-round cultivation. [Source 2]\n•   **Underground Storage:** Treated wastewater can be stored underground, enhancing its availability for irrigation and domestic needs throughout the year. [Source 2]\n\n**Implications**\n•   Provides a sustainable water source to combat increasing water scarcity.\n•   Supports higher cropping intensities and more reliable agricultural production for smallholders.\n•   Creates a potential revenue stream for water utilities (like WASA) through sales, which can be reinvested in operation and maintenance.

However, only farmers with access to untreated wastewater were able to save on fertilizers and achieve higher cropping intensities as well as year-round cultivation which allowed them to earn on average USD 600 per hectare per year more than farmers who used regular irrigation water, easily absorbing the higher water fees set by the WASA (Clemett and Ensink, 2006). By charging farmers for the use of wastewater, WASA is able to recover some of its O&M costs for the wastewater treatment plant, while its main revenue stream (ca",

[Source 2]\n•   **Licensing:** The WUA itself is a licensed entity, with licenses granted by the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and the water authority (PWA). [Source 1]\n\n**Information Gap**\nThe provided excerpts do not specify the practical steps a WUA should take to ensure safe use. The context mentions that safe reuse requires \"strict adherence to set rules and regulations\" and effective communication to users [Source 3], but it does not elaborate on what specific actions the WUA should perform, such as monitoring, training, or enforcement.\n\nTo develop a comprehensive safety plan, you would need details on:\n- Specific water quality monitoring protocols for the WUA to implement.\n- Guidelines for communicating risks and safe practices to farmers.\n- Enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance.\n\nThe documents present the WUA as part of a stakeholder model, but its operational responsibilities for safety are not detailed.
